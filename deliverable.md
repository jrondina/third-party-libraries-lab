# Volley #

Volley is a library that makes HTTP requests easier. HttpClient was deprecated starting Android API 22 so Volley is another 
way of getting those tasks done in modern versions. Volley also makes it so you don't need to do AsyncTask, which are required
because networking cannot be done on the main thread. An example of how volley can be used in an app is to get a JSON object 
or an image file. However in this lab all I'm doing is grabbing an html document as a string and displaying it in a textview.
